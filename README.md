# Triple Negative Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, it’s the second leading cause of cancer death for women worldwide and the third most common cancer in Canada. An interesting/scary fact is one in eight women were expected to develop breast cancer in their lifetime. 

There are four types of breast cancer. The type of cancer really depends on three receptor results; ER, PR and HER2. Basically you can be this receptor positive or negative. If it is positive then that means estrogen progesterone and HER2 is present so drugs are battle this are efffective. Triple Negative breast cancer is know to be the deadliest and faster spreading breast cancer that basically has negative receptors for all three, so the drugs aren’t as efffective as they would be for the other types.
